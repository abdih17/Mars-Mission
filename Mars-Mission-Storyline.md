**Storm is Coming - no question**

It’s the year 2033 and it’s been 2 years since humans first landed on Mars. You are the environmental scientist serving on the second manned mission to mars - Mars Mission 2.

Mars is a harsh environment prone to storms that could jeopardize the mission and the very lives of astronauts serving…

**Wake up**

Beep...Beep...Beep…
Oxygen critically low…Oxygen critically low…

What is your name?
[			]

[User Name	] your oxygen levels are critically low and your suit is leaking oxygen from a puncture wound. What are you going to do?


Wait for you team?
Patch the wound?
Crawl to the base 200 meters away?
Door code: L3Ty5


**Get into the base**

After choosing to abort the mission and flee Mars due to the storm your team left the base. The base by design is self locking. In order to get inside you must enter the door code that was given to you on the previous question. What is the code?
Every try will cost you 1 oxygen and 1 water.

**Fix the water supply**

[User Name	] your water supply is starting to run low and without the water reclaimer you won’t be able to get more water. Unfortunately the water reclaimer was damaged during the storm and is currently not functioning.

Every try will cost you 1 oxygen and 1 water.

**Growing food - no question**

In order to grow potatoes you need:
Water
Fertilizer
Heat

**Attempt to grow food**

Growing food to sustain your life is critical if there is going to be any attempt at a rescue. You currently don’t have enough food to make it. You figure out that you can grow potatoes if you create the perfect environment.

What are the 3 things you need in order to grow potatoes?

**Communicate with Earth**

If there is really any hope of a survival you must make contact with Nasa. Back in the early 2000’s Nasa sent several drones to explore the surface of Mars in preparation for a manned mission. In particular the pathfinder drone was sent to a region close to where you are now. It is possible that you may be able to fix pathfinder to communicate back to earth.

What do you do?

Go search for Pathfinder?
Attempt to fix the existing communication device on the base?
Trust that Nasa will send help and that you can grow enough food to survive?

**Fix the base communicate device**

In order to fix the base communication device you need to input the correct code. Thankfully the base communications computer was written using javascript. In order to fix the communication device you need to create an object literal that includes your name, your mission number, and has a method to send Nasa a message (via alert) of “I AM ALIVE”.

**Nasa says you need to try and make it to a launch site 1000km away**

Nasa is surprised to hear from you and immediately starts working on a rescue plan. After several days of waiting you get a communication instructing you to travel over 1,000 km to the west in order to reach the mission site for Mars Mission 3.


Listen to Nasa
Ignore Nasa and stay

**What do you need to survive the trip?**

The trip to the site of Mars Mission 3 will take several weeks during which time you won’t be able to resupply on oxygen or water. In order to make it safely you will need at least X oxygen and Y water.

Add to your existing oxygen and water supply (needs more work)

**Leave the base**

The day has finally come for you to leave and head to Mars Mission 3 base. Which direction do you head?


East
West
North
South

**You encounter a storm**

No matter what you do you can’t seem to escape the storms on mars. You are too far away from your base to return safely, your only option is to continue to head towards Mars Mission 3 base.

Which way to do you go?

Drive through it?
The shortest possible route but you could die
Drive around it?
Must longer but you might not have enough oxygen and water to make it.

**Mars Mission 3 base**

Nasa has provided you with a specific set of instructions on how to set up the launch vehicle that has been placed at the Mars Mission 3 base. Your only hope for survival is to use this vehicle to escape from Mars and to be picked up in low martian orbit.

The launch vehicle must be prepared in a very specific order. Nasa sent you the instructions but the data was corrupted and you were only able to view the instructions for 5 seconds.

Provide the launch vehicle prep order (you only have one try)

**Rescue Attempt**

3...2...1…

Engine ignition

Lift off

The escape vehicle can get you close but not perfect. In order to the rescue team you will need to exit the launch vehicle. Use the arrow keys to float to the rescue team.
