        <p class="q7">If there is really any hope of a survival you must make contact with Nasa. Back in the early 2000’s Nasa sent several drones to explore the surface of Mars in preparation for a manned mission. In particular the pathfinder drone was sent to a region close to where you are now. It is possible that you may be able to fix pathfinder to communicate back to earth.</p>
