        <p>Born and raised in Philadelphia, I went to high school in Rhode Island, college in Maine, and worked on Wall Street out of college. After a few years in New York City, I moved to Seattle to try something new. I started working in high-tech startups as soon as I arrived. Since then, I've conceived of, launched, and marketed B2B and B2C products for most of my career. But now I want more control to build my own applications. Thus, I'm here at CodeFellows to learn Javascript, HTML, and CSS.</p>

        <p>My name is Hawa, it means 'air' in both Hindi and Arabic. I am a mid-western at heart, but after moving here to Seattle in 2010, Seattle is growing on me slowly but surely. I am currently attending Code Fellows in hopes of becoming a full-stack web developer. I majored in Early Childhood and Elementary Education at the teacher preparation program at Central Washington University. With my background of Education and the skills I gained from CF, I hope to combine my two passions into one very soon.</p>

        <p>I have lived in the Seattle area my entire life, attending a cummunity college north of the city.  After getting an Associate in Fine Arts Degree I decided against continuing with pursuing a 4 year degree.  Instead I pursued career possibilities in Real Estate.  Though I had chosen to not pursue a traditional schooling experience in favor of work, I continued to pursue alternative educational avenues in my free time - Chief among them being web developemnet.</p>

        <p>Born in the midwest and raised on the west coast I have grown up loving all things PNW. Coffee, Rain, and the Seattle Mariners are just a few of my favorite things. I am passionate about the outdoors and you will most likely find me rock climbing, backcountry skiing, or hiking on the weekends.<span>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
